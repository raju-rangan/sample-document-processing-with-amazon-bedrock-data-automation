Sample Document for Testing Document Processing System
=====================================================

Date: July 17, 2025
Document Type: Test Document
Purpose: System Integration Testing

Overview
--------
This document serves as a test case for the document processing system built with Amazon Bedrock, S3, EventBridge, and Lambda functions.

Key Features Being Tested
-------------------------
1. Document Upload to S3
   - Automatic event triggering
   - Metadata extraction
   - Security validation

2. EventBridge Integration
   - Event pattern matching
   - Rule execution
   - Target invocation

3. Lambda Function Processing
   - Event parsing
   - HTTP webhook calls
   - Error handling

4. Bedrock Knowledge Base
   - Document indexing
   - Vector embedding
   - Semantic search capabilities

Test Scenarios
--------------
- Upload various document types (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Verify webhook payload structure
- Test error handling with invalid files
- Validate security permissions
- Monitor performance metrics

Expected Outcomes
-----------------
✓ Document successfully uploaded to S3
✓ EventBridge rule triggered
✓ Lambda function executed without errors
✓ HTTP webhook called with correct payload
✓ Document indexed in Bedrock Knowledge Base
✓ CloudWatch logs show successful processing

Technical Details
-----------------
- S3 Bucket: Encrypted with lifecycle policies
- Lambda Runtime: Python 3.11
- EventBridge: Custom event patterns
- Bedrock Model: Amazon Titan Embed Text v1
- Vector Storage: OpenSearch Serverless

# Document Processing System Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Document Storage
- **Description**: System shall provide secure S3 bucket for document storage
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - S3 bucket with versioning enabled
  - Server-side encryption enabled
  - Public access blocked
  - Lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### FR-002: Event-Driven Processing
- **Description**: System shall trigger HTTP requests when new documents are uploaded
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - EventBridge rule triggered on S3 object creation
  - HTTP endpoint invocation via API Gateway or Lambda
  - Event payload includes object metadata

### FR-003: Vector Storage
- **Description**: System shall provide S3 bucket for vector embeddings storage
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dedicated S3 bucket for vector data
  - Optimized for frequent read/write operations
  - Integration with Bedrock Knowledge Base

### FR-004: Knowledge Base
- **Description**: System shall provide Bedrock Knowledge Base for document retrieval
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Bedrock KB configured with S3 vector store
  - Embedding model configured
  - Query capabilities enabled

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Security
- All S3 buckets must have encryption at rest
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- No public access to sensitive data

### NFR-002: Cost Optimization
- Use appropriate S3 storage classes
- Implement lifecycle policies
- Resource tagging for cost tracking

### NFR-003: Scalability
- Architecture must support small to medium scale
- Auto-scaling capabilities where applicable

### NFR-004: Maintainability
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Modular design with reusable components
- Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Constraints
- AWS as cloud provider
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Small scale deployment (development/testing)
- Latest stable versions of all components
